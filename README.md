Project Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find various projects and experiments related to computer vision, deep learning, and causal representation learning.

Repository Structure

ðŸ“‚ Computer_Vision

This folder contains several Jupyter notebooks related to computer vision. Some of these are derived from a Kaggle competition. Additionally, you'll find a demo video where I experimented with extracting objects from a video.

ðŸ“‚ Deep_Learning

This folder includes Jupyter notebooks where I explored and experimented with different deep learning concepts.

ðŸ“‚ Thesis/experiments

This directory contains part of my thesis experiments. The research focuses on efficiently discovering causal representations between variables.

Feel free to explore the repository and reach out if you have any questions!
